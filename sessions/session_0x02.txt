--[ Abstract

--[ Crypt*
  So to start things off we should probably get an encyclopedic knowledge of some
  of the topics.
  
  + What does Crypto mean?
  + What is Cryptology?
  + What is Cryptanalysi?
  + What is Plaintext?
  + What is Encryption?
  + What is Ciphertext?
  + What is Decryption?

--[ Modulo
  You guys probably know this but just for the sake of the review. Modulus 
  arithmetic is like a clock. Once a value goes over the modulu it wraps
  back around. 

  + 234234 % 3  = ?


--[ Caeser Cipher
  + What is the Caeser Cipher?
  + Write a program that can encrypt and decrypt data with the caesar cipher.

--[ Hashes 
  + What is a hash?
  + In short what does it do?
  + get a md5 hash of a file on your system. 

--[ Steganogrpahy
  
  + What is steganography?
  + How is this different than cryptography?
  + Write a basic python script to hide and retrieve dat from a .jpg
  + 


--[ Why do 
  + Why do we hide things?
  + CIA triangle what is it?
  + What is Confidentiality mean?
  + What is authenticity mean?
  + What does integretiy mean?
  + What does cryptography give us?
  + What does hash functions give us?

--[ Attacking
  + Breaking a hash function?
  + Passwords
  + Breaking an encryption algorithm?
  + Break Caeser Cipher
  + SSL
  + DES
  

--[ Defending 
  + Prevent hash function breaking?
  + Mitigate if hash functions are inevitably broken how to mitigate?
  +
