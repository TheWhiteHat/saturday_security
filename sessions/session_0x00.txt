--[ Preface ]
Getting into ta Hacker/Egineer/Security field is tough. They are all rapidly 
changing. What you know now will most likely be a little relevance in about
5 years and very little relevance in 10. This means the art of how to learn
is just as if not more important than memorizing formulas, languages,
apis, frameworks, tools, etc.
